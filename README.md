# Vibe - Music Recommendation System
### Find music that you'll vibe with!

Final project for the McGill AI Society's Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning Bootcamp (Fall 2023). 
Original dataset of songs retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks/).

## Description

Vibe is a content-based music recommendation system with a database of fifty thousand unique artists and a million songs released between 2000 and 2023. The system can handle both artists and specific songs as input; recommendations are generated using SciPy's cdist method by selecting the songs in the dataset with the lowest Euclidean distance from the given input.

## Using the app
